    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Welcome to PotBazar! Your privacy is important to us. Please read our policy to understand how we handle your data.</p>
    
    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>We collect personal data such as name, email, shipping address, and payment details when you make a purchase or sign up for our newsletter.</p>
    
    <h2>Purpose of Data Use</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To process and fulfill orders.</li>
        <li>To send promotional emails and gardening tips.</li>
        <li>To improve website experience.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal requirements.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We may share data with third parties such as shipping companies, payment processors, and marketing partners, but we do not sell your data without consent.</p>
    
    <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p>We use cookies for website functionality, analytics, and advertising. You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement security measures like SSL encryption to protect your data, though no system is 100% secure.</p>
    
    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, update, or delete your data. Contact us at support@potbazar.com for such requests.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>Our website may contain links to external sites. Clicking on those means their privacy policies apply, not ours.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy anytime. Continued use of our site implies acceptance of changes.</p>
    
    <h2>Returns & Refund Policy for Plants</h2>
    <p>
      Please note that <strong>plants are living products</strong> and are <strong>not eligible for return or exchange</strong> once purchased and delivered. This policy is in place because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Plants are sensitive to changes in environment, handling, and care after leaving our facility.</li>
      <li>We ensure all plants are healthy and well-cared for before shipping.</li>
      <li>Responsibility for plant care passes to the customer upon delivery.</li>
      <li>Plants are perishable and their condition can change quickly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Exceptions:</strong> If your plant arrives damaged or unhealthy, please contact us within 24 hours of delivery with photos. We will review your case and may offer a replacement or refund at our discretion.
    </p>
